# Small Raytracing Engine

A Small Ray tracing engine for understanding vector logic and generating composable ray-traced scenes. Learning about this
project from "Ray tracing in one weekend" to understand the initial logic behind the scenes and to grant myself a foundation
of learning to achieve a better outcome. Whilst creating this project I found the books such as:
"Computational Optimizations, Methods and Algorithms" By Koziel & Yang; and "Real-time Rendering" by Akiene-Moller, Haines and Hoffman.
Both of which, have been - and still are greatly supporting me as I journey into the world of computer graphics. I hope to take this
knowledge to more projects eventually, mabye more on the physics engine side but we will see what will come.

# Goals:
- Learning About 3D Graphics
- Understanding math of vectors
- Generating Optimized scenes
- Using Build systems: CMake and CMake Generators such as Ninja (my favourite)
- Having Fun!

A Huge thanks to Peter and his Guide for making this project possible! I would have never stumbled into interest over graphics
If it wasnt for his clear and concise methods for showing newbies like me how it can evolve
